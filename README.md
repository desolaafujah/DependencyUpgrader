# DependencyUpgrader
This tool is a project built towards improving developer experience. This project was inspired by an internship project I did Summer 2025 and there I developed an interest in building tools towards improving developer experience. This tool starts off as a crawler through repo dependencies, going through files such as package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc. (using agentic AI), an LLM component would figure out what needs to be updated and resolve any breaking changes and create a PR, notifying the owner of the repo of the changes that could be changed and itâ€™s up to the developer to approve the PR.
